I'm currently a master student of Nankai University, with my interest covering . At CMU, my capstone project is on multi-view pose estimation, with professor Katerina Fragkiadaki. I interned at Facebook AI Research mentored by Priya Goyal and Abhinav Gupta. 
I have a track record of contributing to CNN efficient inference during my undergrad study. Particularly, I designed channel pruning to effectively prune channels. I further proposed AMC to sample the design space of channel pruning via reinforcement learning, which greatly improved the performance. 
I served as a reviewer for ECCV'20, ICML'20, CVPR'20, ICLR'20, ICCV'19, CVPR'19, ICLR'19, NIPS'18, Pattern Recognition Letters, TIP and IJCV.

### Research Experience
- **2018--present: Financial Networks and Systematic Risk, _Hunan University_**  
Firstly, I developed both static and dynamic volatility connectedness measures of global foreign exchange
(forex) markets based on LASSO-VAR approaches in the variance decomposition framework.
Then I constructed the high dimensional volatility connectedness network linking more than 40 major currencies and
explored factors driving risk contagion between forex markets by analyzing properties of the complex
networks. In the empirical research, I calculated the volatility spillover index (see e.g., [rolling total volatility spillover index of currencies](/RTVSI.png)) and enabled network visualization (see e.g., [volatility connectedness network of currencies](/VCNC.jpg)). My undergraduate thesis (see the [Abstract](/Abs.pdf)) was completed on this basis. Then with the instruction of my supervisor, I 
completed and revised the manuscript which has been accepted by _Journal of Multinational Financial
Management_.
