### Research Experience
- **2018--present: Financial Networks and Systematic Risk, _Hunan University_**  
Firstly, I developed both static and dynamic volatility connectedness measures of global foreign exchange
(forex) markets based on LASSO-VAR approaches in the variance decomposition framework.
Then I constructed the high dimensional volatility connectedness network linking more than 40 major currencies and
explored factors driving risk contagion between forex markets by analyzing properties of the complex
networks. In the empirical research, I calculated the volatility spillover index and enabled network visualization. My undergraduate thesis (see the [Abstract](/Abs.pdf)) was completed on this basis. Then with the instruction of my supervisor, I 
completed and revised the manuscript which has been accepted by _Journal of Multinational Financial
Management_.
